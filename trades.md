### 2026-09-06T14:37:35.538Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh actionable trigger. Price is in a mild established uptrend (4h +0.63%, 1h +1.18% over 48h) with fast SMA already above slow SMA, but crossed_this_candle is false — this is a continuation, not a new signal. RSI 14 (4h) is neutral at 55.2, no oversold/overbought condition to react to. 24h volume is only 0.43x its 7-day average, well below the 2x flag threshold, so there's no conviction-confirming volume spike. Order book is bid-heavy (imbalance 0.86) but that alone, without a fresh crossover or RSI extreme, isn't sufficient corroboration to open a position — would be chasing an already-priced-in move rather than reacting to a real signal.

### 2026-09-06T14:37:39.479Z — ETH/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** Similar to BTC/USD: an established mild uptrend (4h +2.03%, 1h +2.22% over 48h) with fast SMA already above slow SMA, but no fresh crossover this candle — nothing new to react to. RSI 14 (4h) at 59.6 is neutral, not oversold, so there's no dip-buy setup, and it's not overbought either so no reversal signal. 24h volume is 0.83x its 7-day average, below the 2x flag, so the move isn't confirmed by unusual volume. Order book is bid-heavy (imbalance 0.76) but on its own doesn't justify an entry without a fresh crossover, RSI extreme, or volume confirmation. Logging no trade rather than chasing an already-established move.

### 2026-09-06T14:52:39.440Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No change from the prior cycle 15 minutes ago. Still no fresh trigger: fast SMA remains above slow SMA with no new crossover this candle, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 55.2, 24h volume still well below its 7-day average (0.43x, no spike flag). Order book has flattened to near-neutral (imbalance 0.05, down from 0.86 last cycle), so even the mild bullish order-book tilt from before has faded. No basis for an entry.

### 2026-09-06T14:52:44.458Z — ETH/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No change from the prior cycle 15 minutes ago. Fast SMA still above slow SMA with no fresh crossover, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 59.6, 24h volume still below its 7-day average (0.83x, no spike flag). Order book bullish tilt has eased somewhat (imbalance 0.34, down from 0.76 last cycle). No fresh signal to act on.

### 2026-09-06T15:16:37.655Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** Still no fresh trigger. Fast SMA remains above slow SMA with no new crossover this candle, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 55.2, 24h volume still well below its 7-day average (0.43x, no spike flag). Short-term momentum has actually cooled (1h/48h pct change down to 0.16% from 1.18% last cycle). Order book shows a moderate bid tilt (0.41) but that alone doesn't corroborate an entry without a fresh crossover or RSI extreme.

### 2026-09-06T15:22:51.601Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh trigger. Fast SMA still above slow SMA with no new crossover this candle, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 55.2, 24h volume still well below its 7-day average (0.43x, no spike flag). Order book has moved back toward neutral (imbalance 0.12). Nothing here rises above background noise.

### 2026-09-06T15:22:53.451Z — ETH/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** Signals conflict: price action and 4h SMA structure remain in a mild uptrend (fast SMA above slow, no fresh crossover) with neutral RSI (59.6) and unflagged volume (0.83x avg), but the order book has flipped sharply ask-heavy (imbalance -0.71, versus +0.34/+0.03 the last two cycles) - a notable short-term reversal in book pressure against the prevailing trend. With no fresh crossover or RSI extreme to lean on, and the book now pointing the opposite direction from the trend, this is exactly the conflicting-signals case the instructions call out for a no-trade rather than picking a side.

### 2026-09-06T15:25:01.806Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh trigger. Fast SMA still above slow SMA with no new crossover, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 55.2, 24h volume still well below its 7-day average (0.43x, no spike flag). Order book has drifted slightly ask-heavy (imbalance -0.15) but remains close to neutral - not a meaningful signal on its own.

### 2026-09-06T15:25:08.390Z — ETH/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh trigger. Fast SMA still above slow SMA with no new crossover, RSI 14 (4h) neutral at 59.6, 24h volume still below its 7-day average (0.83x, no spike flag). Order book has settled back to fully neutral (imbalance -0.01), resolving last cycle's conflicting ask-heavy tilt without producing any new actionable signal.

### 2026-09-06T15:33:08.971Z — BTC/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh trigger. RSI 4h neutral at 55.2 (no overbought/oversold). SMA already fast-above-slow but no crossover this candle (trend already priced in, not a fresh signal). 24h volume at 0.43x the 7-day average — well below the 2x flag threshold, so the modest +0.16%/+0.63% price drift isn't volume-confirmed. Order book roughly balanced (+0.057). Nothing here rises above noise.

### 2026-09-06T15:33:10.865Z — ETH/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** No fresh trigger. RSI 4h neutral at 59.6. SMA fast-above-slow but no crossover this candle. 24h volume at 0.83x the 7-day average, not flagged. Positive price action (+1.08%/+2.03%) but unconfirmed by volume, and order book actually skews slightly toward asks (-0.074), which cuts against chasing the move. No actionable signal combination per the rules.

```json

### 2026-09-06T15:33:14.284Z — SOL/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** Signals conflict. Strong price momentum (+4.2%/+4.94% over 48h) and RSI climbing to 65.5 (approaching but not overbought), but no SMA crossover this candle (trend state unchanged) and 24h volume is actually below its 7-day average (0.84x, not flagged) — the move isn't volume-confirmed, which is a warning sign for chasing a rally already in progress. Order book roughly flat (-0.036). Not logging a trade on unconfirmed momentum alone.

**Signals considered:**
```json
{
  "rsi_14_4h": 65.51,

### 2026-09-06T15:33:17.389Z — POL/USD — NO TRADE

**Reasoning:** Signals conflict. Sharp price rally (+5.01%/+6.01% over 48h) and strong bid-side order book imbalance (+0.335), but the 4h SMA state is still bearish (fast_below_slow, no crossover yet) and 24h volume is well below its 7-day average (0.27x, not flagged) — the rally is not confirmed by either trend structure or volume. RSI neutral at 56.7. Conflicting signals mean no trade this cycle.

**Signals considered:**
